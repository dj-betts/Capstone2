-**Bias detection** 
- *Features:* NLP of articles posted on twitter and facebook.  I want to focus on certain type of words that tend to be highly biased, for example "absolutes"  (i.e. 'totally', 'finally', 'all', 'every') for language that is more "nuanced" (i.e. idk. not those words?). OR I could pull all articles from a newspapers and analyze articles from op-ed, editorial, and new desks.
- *Target1:* predicitng if an article is "fake" based on words used
- *Target2:* measure the bias of an article based on the words with some threshold of bias vs. opinion. it to NLP of podcasts and youtube channels.
- *Target3:* model that correctly guesses whether an article is from an op-ed section or not. These are all a similar idea.
- *Resources:* Twitter or Facebook API w/ articles flagged as "fake". NYTimes op-ed vs news desk.
- *Obstacles:* It feels like a big project and I'm not sure if it's in my skill set.
