# Proposal Checklist 
- Business Case: the capstone should have a goal. 
- The project should have some minimal endpoint that will be interesting to someone. 
- Scope: Can you complete the capstone in one week? 
    There should be minimal risk that you won’t be able to complete the basic project. Stretch goals are encouraged but the proposal should define a basic project that will meet the requirements of a capstone. 
- Available Data: Can you get the data? 
    The proposal must include a plan to acquire the data, including the location. If there is a chance of problems collecting the data, you must collect enough before that you can estimate the time and effort required to collect the rest. 
- Real Data: Is real data involved? 
    Projects cannot be based on fake data. 
    Projects must have some initial data (e.g., a recommendation engine without any recommendations to start isn’t acceptable) It’s fine to collect your own data (e.g., take pictures), but you must be able to get enough to have valid conclusions. 
- Appropriate Data 
    Is the data appropriate to answer the question at hand? 
    If the data is pre-aggregated in some way, does the aggregation destroy the granularity you need to answer the question? 
- Novelty: Is your capstone different from work others have done? 
    Minor differences are sufficient. For example, a home-pricing app is fine as long as it includes some feature not obviously included in Zillow, or asks different questions, or targets different users. 
    Kaggle or similar projects are not acceptable, or projects exclusively based on Kaggle data, even if your model follows a different approach than others might take. 
    Projects done in partnership with another company or organization are good choices as long they actually provide value to the partner (and are not, for example, a re-analysis of a problem others have solved). 
    Attempts to replicate research or projects of others, while valuable in general, is often more difficult than expected and should be discussed with the instructors. 
    Plagiarism is absolutely unacceptable. All significant contributions from anyone other than the instructors must be noted. If you aren’t sure, ask the instructors. 
- Data Science 
Capstones should demonstrate clear knowledge of data science and use tools learned during the program.
